# E-Health OntoForge
---
## Problem Statement

Inter-organizational collaborations in the health and biomedical domain face challenges due to the insufficient integration of enterprises. Different interpretations of terms and the lack of standardized vocabularies hinder effective collaboration, leading to issues in delivering proper content quickly to the appropriate customers. The existing systems often struggle with accurate predictions, recommendations, and the integration of business processes among enterprises in the e-health environment.

E-Health OntoForge addresses these challenges by proposing a solution that leverages ontologies and Semantic Web technologies to create a more flexible and interconnected system for health-related information. By extending the ontology model to the business-to-consumer (B2C) field, the project aims to personalize knowledge representation over user profiles, enabling effective customization of service-based business processes.

## Overview

E-Health OntoForge is a project designed to revolutionize the way health and biomedical information is organized, accessed, and utilized. The key components of the project include:

1. **Extraction of Data:**
   - Method: Extracts definitions of terms related to specific diagnoses from reliable sources, such as the Thesaurus of the National Cancer Institute.
   - Purpose: Structuring concepts and creating connections between them.

2. **Extraction of Concepts and Relationships:**
   - Method: Utilizes ontologies, including models like UMLS and GO, to acquire concepts and relationships for building comprehensive ontologies.
   - Purpose: Facilitates the integration of business processes and enhances collaboration among enterprises.

3. **Conceptualization:**
   - Activity: Involves structuring knowledge through tasks such as extracting information from domain experts and employing a manual or semi-automatic method for ontology construction.
   - Goal: Building robust ontologies to support the customization of service-based business processes.

4. **Semantic Web Search:**
   - Technology: Implements Semantic Web technologies to create semantic relationships between data, providing a network of linked health-related information.
   - Focus: Enhancing the interoperability of information systems in the e-Health domain.
